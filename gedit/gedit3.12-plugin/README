ShoebotIt: Shoebot plugin for Gedit
===================================

This Gedit plugin adds a menu to allow for running Shoebot scripts.
It will open a Shoebot window using the current document as the Shoebot code.

Installing
==========

Run on your terminal
  python install.py


Then enable the plugin from the Gedit plugins menu (Edit-Preferences-Plugins).

Using with Virtualenv
=====================

The plugin includes a virtualenv chooser, you can add any virtualenv
that has shoebot installed.

It will also search for virtualenvs in ~/.virtualenvs the default
location for virtualenvwrapper - any with shoebot will be listed.

Default Virtualenv
------------------

Selecting Default will use the env that was active when Gedit
was started (start GEdit from the terminal after activating
the env).

If Shoebot is not found, this will fallback to the System Python.

System Env
----------

This will attempt to use the system python, Shoebot needs to
be installed there for this to work.
